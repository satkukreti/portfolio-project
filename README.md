Part 2 of my Django-Python-WebDev projects.

Another follow-along-and-code tutorial I did. It was very fun and interesting, especially after learning about Bootstrap! I was always scared of making websites because they looked so... bland. CSS definately helps, but I was limited in what I knew and I did not want to spend a lot of time in it. Other than that, this was one of my first times working with a database. Oh, and I love the admin feature in this website! I could make changes to my website without having to git push/pull. I think its because of the database I used?
